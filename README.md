# Docker-in-Docker Project with Traefik

This project demonstrates how to set up a Docker-in-Docker (DinD) environment with Traefik as a reverse proxy. The main DinD container automatically builds and runs sub-dockers. Sub-dockers can be built from local Dockerfiles or pulled directly from Docker Hub. Additionally, you can execute commands on the sub-dockers after they are running or enter an interactive shell.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-in-docker-project.git
   cd docker-in-docker-project
   ```

2. **Make all scripts executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   chmod +x subdocker-*/build-subdocker-*.sh
   ```

3. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

4. **Optional: If you have multiple subdockers and want to build them, you can run after you are done building**:
   ```bash
   for dir in subdocker-*; do
       chmod +x "$dir"/build-subdocker-*.sh
       ./"$dir"/build-subdocker-*.sh
   done
   ```

This allows the user to easily handle multiple subdocker names without needing to specify each one individually. The loop will ensure that all `build-subdocker-*.sh` scripts in the subdocker directories are executed.

   This script will build the necessary Docker images and start the containers for DinD and Traefik.

3. **Execute Commands**: After the setup, you can choose to execute a specific command in `subdocker-1`. When prompted, enter the command you want to run.

4. **Interactive Shell**: You can also choose to enter an interactive shell in `subdocker-1` after the setup.
   ```bash
   docker exec -it subdocker-1-container bash
   ```
- `docker exec` This command is used to run a new command in a running container.
- `-it` These options enable interactive mode.
- `-i` keeps the standard input (STDIN) open.
- `-t` allocates a pseudo-TTY, which is necessary for interactive terminal applications.
- `subdocker-1-container`: This is the name of the container you want to access.
- `bash`: This specifies the command you want to run inside the container, which in this case is the Bash shell.


## Security Considerations

When using Docker-in-Docker, security is a major concern due to the sharing of the Docker socket. Here are a few security practices:

- **User Permissions**: It is recommended to create a non-root user within the DinD container to run applications with limited permissions. Modify your Dockerfile as follows:

    ```dockerfile
    # Example: Adding a non-root user
    RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash dinduser
    USER dinduser
    ```

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information, such as API keys or secrets, to avoid hardcoding them in your scripts.

## Persistent Storage

Managing persistent storage is crucial, especially for applications like databases or services that need to retain data between restarts. Here's how to define volumes in your `docker-compose.yml` for persistent data.

### Example Persistent Storage Configuration in `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  subdocker-1:
    build:
      context: ./subdocker-1
    networks:
      my_custom_network:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.1.10
    volumes:
      - subdocker-1-data:/data  # Volume for persistent storage
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:80"]  # Change the URL to match your service
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

volumes:
  subdocker-1-data:  # Named volume definition
```

In this example, a named volume `subdocker-1-data` is created and mounted to the `/data` directory inside `subdocker-1`. Any data written to `/data` will be retained in the volume, even if the container is removed.

To verify that the data is indeed persistent, you can run the following commands:

1. **Start the containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access the subdocker and create a file**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it subdocker-1-container bash
   echo "Hello, Persistent World!" > /data/hello.txt
   exit
   ```

3. **Stop and remove the containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

4. **Start the containers again**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Check if the file still exists**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it subdocker-1-container bash
   cat /data/hello.txt  # Should output: Hello, Persistent World!
   ```


## Health Checks

You can add health checks to monitor the status of your services. Below is an example health check configuration for `subdocker-1`, which will periodically make an HTTP request to the service to verify it is up and running.

### Example Health Check Configuration in `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
  subdocker-1:
    build:
      context: ./subdocker-1
    networks:
      my_custom_network:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.1.10
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:80"]  # Change the URL to match your service
      interval: 30s  # Check every 30 seconds
      timeout: 10s   # Timeout after 10 seconds
      retries: 3     # Retry up to 3 times before marking as unhealthy
```

## Error Handling

To improve error handling in your build and run scripts, you can check the exit status of commands. Hereâ€™s an example of how to implement error handling in the `build-subdocker-1.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Building subdocker-1 from local Dockerfile..."
if ! docker build -t subdocker-1 .; then
    echo "Failed to build subdocker-1"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Running subdocker-1..."
if ! docker run --name subdocker-1-container -d subdocker-1; then
    echo "Failed to run subdocker-1"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Traefik Configuration

This project uses Traefik to manage routing to sub-dockers. The Traefik configuration is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. **Traefik Service**: The following configuration sets up Traefik to handle incoming requests:

```yaml
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.5
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"  # Enable the Traefik dashboard (not for production)
      - "--providers.docker=true"  # Enable Docker provider
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"  # Listen on port 80
    ports:
      - "80:80"  # Expose port 80
      - "8080:8080"  # Expose the Traefik dashboard
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"  # Access Docker socket
```

## Sub-Docker Builds

This project demonstrates two methods for running sub-dockers within the DinD environment:

### 1. Build a Sub-Docker from a Local Dockerfile

The script `build-subdocker-1.sh` is responsible for building and running `subdocker-1` using a local Dockerfile.

The local Dockerfile for `subdocker-1` installs a basic tool (in this case, `curl`):

```dockerfile
# subdocker-1 Dockerfile
FROM debian:latest

# Update package list and install curl
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the command script into the image
COPY run-commands.sh /usr/local/bin/run-commands.sh

# Set the script as the default command
CMD ["bash", "/usr/local/bin/run-commands.sh"]
```

### 2. Pull and Run a Pre-Built Sub-Docker from Docker Hub

The script `build-subdocker-2.sh` pulls a pre-built image from Docker Hub and runs it as a container.

## Port and IP Assignments

For better network management, this project uses custom IP addresses and port assignments in the Docker network configuration. The `docker-compose.yml` file specifies the network settings, allowing you to define static IPs for each service.

### Example IP Assignment in `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
  subdocker-1:
    build:
      context: ./subdocker-1
    networks:
      my_custom_network:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.1.10

  subdocker-2:
    image: nginx:latest
    networks:
      my_custom_network:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.1.20
